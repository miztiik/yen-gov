# AGENTS.md - frontend/src

**Last Updated**: 2026-05-15

Canonical frontend rationale lives in `docs/architecture/frontend/`; this file is only a fast module map for agents.

## Canonical Docs

- [Frontend overview](../../docs/architecture/frontend/overview.md)
- [Frontend data loading](../../docs/architecture/frontend/data-loading.md)
- [Indicators UI](../../docs/architecture/frontend/indicators.md)
- [Map architecture](../../docs/architecture/frontend/map.md)
- [Colour system](../../docs/architecture/frontend/colours.md)
- [Compare flows](../../docs/architecture/frontend/compare.md)
- [Deployment](../../docs/architecture/deployment.md)

## Invariants

- Static GitHub Pages app; anything needed at runtime ships in the bundle.
- Do not import from `backend/`.
- Do not commit generated data from `frontend/`; consume `datasets/` at build time.
- Citizen-visible route changes need frontend tests and integrated-browser smoke verification per [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#13-ui-verification-mandatory-for-frontend--admin-changes).
- Catalogue-driven UI should read schemas/catalogues instead of hardcoding one-off dataset lists.

## Validation

- Run `npm test` in `frontend/` for frontend code changes.
- Run `npm run test:e2e` in `frontend/` for citizen-visible route changes.
- If package manifests change, regenerate and stage the matching `bun.lock`.
